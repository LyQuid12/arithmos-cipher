# Arithmos Cipher
Arithmos Cipher is the most simple [Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) that I created myself in [Python](https://python.org). Arithmos is taken from the Greek word (Arithmós or αριθμός) which means "Number".

# Explanation of how it works
Basically, the given sentences will be exchanged with numbers in alphabetical order (Example: `a = 01` to `z = 26` and `A = 27` to `Z = 52`). For numbers with one digit will be added `0` in front of it. Each one of the alphabet has a `2` digit number. And for `uppercase letters` starting from the number `27` after lowercase `(z = 26)`. For more on it, can be seen in the [dictionary](https://github.com/LyQuid12/arithmos-cipher/blob/master/dictionary.py)[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Z7zEc7AXQ)
